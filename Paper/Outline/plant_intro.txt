Communities in ecological contexts are complex structures. Several 
types of relationships between species exist in communities, which create
layers of interdependance. The study of these relationships and their 
effects on the community structures has significant ecological 
implications \cite{Brons2006}. 

Mutualistic relationships are especially interesting because of their
contrast with competition or predator-prey-based relationships. 
Plant-pollinator networks are a
common but ecologiciaclly crucial example of mutualistic relationships.
(Ollerton et al. 2011)[2]. These mutualistic networks comprise a large
number of diverse plants and pollinators (Bascompte and Jordano 2007)[3], 
and they fill an importnat role in many land ecosystems. 
Seventy-five percent of leading food crop production depends on
pollinators (Klein et al. 2007)[4].

Despite the critical enviornmental role of plant-pollinator networks, 
there exist many open questions regarding the community structure, 
inter-species dependancies, and network stability under enviornmental
pertubation such as climate change (Hegland et al. 2009)[5].
