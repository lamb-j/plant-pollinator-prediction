  1. Title
 
  2. Abstract
    - plant-pollinator networks and their importance
    - recommender systems
    - application of implicit feedback to plant-pollinator network
    - possible interpretation of results

  3. Introduction
    - plant-pollination in HJA, more details about importance
    - bipartite network representation of the plant-pollinator network
    (figure of bipartite)
    - recommendor systems
    - collaborative filtering systems
    - explicit feedback vs implicit feedback
    - implicit Feedback system and why it's appropriate

  4. Data Collection
    - complex -> meadow -> plot distictions
    - flower survey
      : considerations for composite flowers
    - interaction survey (recording methods especially)
    - identification methods (photos, samples, kill jars)
    - data sturucture
    - completion methods for unidentified plants

  5. Methods
    - considerations/redefinitions of varibles for application
       to the plant-pollinator network
    - implementation of IFMF
    - testing and training methods
      : potential weakness of training methods
      : dividing by subplots
      : removal/completion training
    (figure of number comparisons)
    - parameter tuning

  6. Results
    - visualization of resulting preferecne matricies
    (figures of the color matricies)
    - results with different parameter tunings and preference thresholds
    - explanations of the visualizations
      : what we're looking for, what would be indications of ecological
      importance

  7. Discussion/Future Work
    - comparison with lower bound
    - comparison with baseline (populatiry-based preferences)
      : From what I've observed so far, the recommendation system
      seems to compute high preferences for popular flowers, which is
      expected. However, it would be interesting to see where this 
      hypothesis fails (and potentially ecologically significant).
    - comparison with Rebecca's choice method and how they differ
    - comparison with Andy's matrix
    (figure of Andy's matrix from his powerpoint presented in Spain)
    - recommendation explanations
    - weighting of pmatrix by insect/plant size
    - figuring out a way to account for plant seasonality
    - possible ecological interpretations of latent factors
    - ecological justificatiosn for caring about missed observations
    - possible applications to other mutualistic animal networks
