- Currently validating the correctness of my matrix decomposition
   - generate some data where I know the answer and see if it matches

- Choice of training sets vs. testing sets
    - division of subplots within the meadow
    - (year/meadow division?)
    - 

- Should we reduce the testing set to only distinct entries from the training set?

- Ecological goals
    - compare highly-predicted interaction's with Andy's ecologically-inspired preference-prediction matrix


To Do:

  Finish validating correctness of matrix decomp
  
  


Julia's comments:
  Use only only zeros from training set to detect differences. 
  predict both by dividing subplots and removing stuff
