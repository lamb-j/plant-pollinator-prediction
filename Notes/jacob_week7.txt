Rough problem statement:

  I plan to use link-prediction algorithms to determine possible
unobserved plant-pollinator interactions in our bipartite plant-
pollinator networks. 
  
  Andy Moldenke theorizes that almost all physically possible
interactions probably occur. He has created a type of color-coded
probability matrix for the possible interactions based on ecological
observations and intuition. 

  I think it would be interesting to generate a matrix by applying 
link-prediction to our data, and then compare this to Andy's matrix,
which could to some degree either validate or nullify his theory.

  Also, I would like to implement, along with the link-prediction 
algorithms, personal intuition gained by collecting data. For 
example, I hypothesize that the probability of detection is 
inversely correlated to the sizes of the insects and flowers. 
However, for plot watches with few large insects, this may not be 
the case (if there are no large insects constantly visiting the plot,
I am more likely to search harder for smaller insects and flowers).

Method:

[f] implicit feedback        (matrix factorization)

- Although the oldest method I've researched so far, implicit 
feedback [4] seems to match the plant-pollinator dataset very well.
Higher numbers of observations don't necessarily indicate 
preference, but confidence of the observation.

Method considerations:
- Assuming I can feasibly implement this method in R or another
appropriate programming language, I think this method best fits
our data set.
would be to implement in R (or some other programming language if 
choosing which methods to implement.
