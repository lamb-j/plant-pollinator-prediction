Week 3 Update - Jacob Lambert
EISI July 4, 2014

Week 3 at HJA was very interesting. We spent most of the week collecting data in the meadows, 
and I am now more confident my ability to identify plants and collect pollinators. 
Regarding my personal project idea, this week I have refined one possible avenue for research.  

I have decided to explore the idea of applying machine learning approaches to our plant-pollinator 
network. The main goal is to train a machine using our data and known ecological observations 
that can then classify and categorize other plants and pollinators. I have also looked into some 
collaborative filtering algorithms, such as those used by amazon and netflix, for determining a pollinator's
preferences for unobserved interactions. Currently I am preparing to research different algorithms 
in order to find one that can provide the best results with our available data.

On an unrelated note, I also considered the creation of an agent-based model of the
plant-pollinator network and what we could learn from it, but I have not had time to research
this idea.

I plan to coordinate further with Jorge and Rebecca for direction and advice regarding 
these research idea.
