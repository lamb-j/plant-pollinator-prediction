EISI - Week 5 Update
Jacob Lambert

After speaking with Tom and Jorge on Tuesday, I have decided to focus on link prediction methods for our plant-pollinator network. I have researched
a few methods, and I plan to read more before choosing which specific methods would be most appropriate and accurate for our dataset. 

Some link prediction methods used in practice can be divided into two categories, rating systems and association systems. The rating systems
use your current ratings and other users ratings to predict ratings for your unrated items. If we could find a way to project a rating mechanism 
onto our network, we could apply those types of methods and take advantage of the edge weights in our network. Alternatively, the other link 
prediction methods would use only the binary association matrix. 

Methods researched so far:

  - preferential attachment (local)
  - von Neumann kernel
  - hyperbolic sin

Considerations

  - weighted vs binary edges (conversion of normalized edge weights to ratings?)
  - random vs nonrandom replacement/removal of edges for generation and testing
  - inclusion of traits to weight edge or edge existence (pre-algorithm)
  - potential coefficient of produced predictive values based on size, rarity, generality, or other traits (post-algorithm)

Goal
  - compare different methods and different parameters
  - implications for extinction cascades, network stability, and possible unobserved dependencies

To research
  - additional methods and algorithms
  - implementation of algorithms
