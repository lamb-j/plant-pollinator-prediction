# Implicit Feedback Recommendation for Plant-pollinator Networks
Summer 2014, Rainbow, Oregon, EISI REU

This project involved several months of data collection in montane meadows of the Pacific Northwest Cascade range, accompanied by a data-driven research project. Data was collected regarding plant-pollinator interactions across different meadows, requiring knowledge of specific species of vegetation and visual identification of several insect species. My specific data-driven project involved a method adapting recommender system collaborative filtering algorithms to the plant-pollinator network in an attempt to quantify pollinator preferences and tendencies, and to predict future behavior.
